# 🕵️‍♀️Avoiding Plagiarism with ChatGPT

Detecting AI generated text is a big problem for safety researchers and educators, among others. Tools like GPTZero, GPT2 detector, and bilingual detectors have seen significant success, However, they can be tricked. The problem of AI text detection will likely be an arms race as new models and new detection methods are introduced. Many companies have already started to build solutions which they claim are very effective, but it is difficult to prove this, especially as models change over time.

## Methods of Detection

#### 1. 🕵️‍♂️OpenAI Text Classifier

The OpenAI Text Classifier is a model trained on a large quantity of AI-generated data and human-written text of a similar quality, the detector is able to compute the likelihood that any given text was created by an LLM.

#### 2. 🔍The Watermark Method
Another method to detect AI generated text requires introducing a watermark when generating the text. These techniques may use a LLM “whitelist” , which is a method of determining if text was generated by a specific AI model.
#### 3. 🧐DetectGPT
The DetectGPT4 method is able to detect AI-generated text
with less setup than the previous concepts. Researchers have
found that LLM text generations tend to "occupy negative
curvature regions of the model’s log probability function".
#### 3. 🤫How to Trick Detection
With the development of AI-generated text detectors, there has been an evolution of methods to counteract them. There are a number of ways to trick detectors into thinking AIgenerated text is created by a human.

## 🖊️Editing Strategies
Replacing words with synonyms, changing the rate words appear, and mixing up syntax or formatting makes it more difficult for detectors to correctly identify text as AIgenerated. Another editing strategy is putting invisible markers, such as 0-width spaces, into your text, emojis, or other uncommon characters.
