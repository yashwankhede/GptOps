# 👋 Introduction 

## 🤖 ChatGPT, ChatGPT, ChatGPT.

### So I'm assuming that by now, you guys have heard of ChatGPT, right? 🤔💭 
Chatbots have been around for a while, and they're pretty important in modern-day communication. But AI-powered chatbots are a whole new level of cool. In this section, we're gonna dive into what ChatGPT-4 is, and cover some of the history behind the model.💡🤖

### 🤖 What Is ChatGPT?
ChatGPT-4 is an AI-powered chatbot developed by OpenAI, a research organization dedicated to creating advanced artificial intelligence technologies. ChatGPT-4 is based on the Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) language model, which is the latest version of the GPT series. The GPT-4 model was trained on a massive amount of text data - as much as a rumored 100 trillion parameters.💻🧐

Essentially, these parameters help it understand natural language and generate human-like responses. In addition, this chatbot relies on a large multimodal model, accepting image and text inputs while emitting text outputs. ChatGPT-4 is designed to engage in human-like conversations, provide personalized responses, and understand the context of any conversation.🤝📈

### ❓What is the difference between GPT-4 and GPT-3.5?
ChatGPT-4 is the latest iteration of OpenAI’s GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) series, which includes GPT-1, GPT-2, GPT-3 (and its update GPT 3.5), and now GPT-4. These models have been trained on increasingly greater amounts of data and are extremely adept at generating coherent and contextually relevant text.💬💻

So yea, you’re safe in thinking that the main difference between ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4 is the amount of data used to train the language models. ChatGPT-4 has as much as ten times the number of parameters as ChatGPT-3.5, making it much more powerful.💪🤖

With more parameters, the model has a greater capacity to learn from the data it is trained on, and therefore can generate more accurate and human-like responses.🤖👥

## To summarise:

### 📷GPT-4 Can Understand Images:
One of ChatGPT-4’s most incredible new features is its ability to process both text and pictures, in what is being called “multimodal” technology.

In other words, you can upload images and ChatGPT will recognise them.🤖👥

### 📈Larger Word Limit:
The introduction of GPT-4 now means that the language model is capable of handling a 25,000-word input limit, up from 8,000 in GPT-3.5.

### 🎯Higher Accuracy:
Chat GPT-4 is meant to give users substantially more accurate responses to their queries. According to OpenAI’s update announcement, ChatGPT-4 is "40% more likely to produce factual responses than GPT-3.5." GPT-4 also has more advanced reasoning capabilities when compared to ChatGPT3.5.

### 🚀Access During Peak Times:
ChatGPT's huge popularity has meant that the chatbot’s website can be particularly overloaded at times, cutting out access to its features. However, GPT-4 promises to solve that problem with access even during peak times.

### ⚡Faster Responses:
ChatGPT usually generates its responses in a matter of minutes or even seconds. ChatGPT Plus promises to be even faster enabling more efficient and productive interactions.

### 🎨More Creativity:
There’s no doubt that ChatGPT-4 is the most collaborative and creative version of the AI so far, particularly when faced with complex and intricate situations. This is noticeable as the bot is capable of processing more instructions than GPT-3.5. For example, ChatGPT-4 is capable of learning a user’s writing style and producing, for example, an essay or a screenplay in the same style.

### 🌏Supports More Languages:
AI tech has predominantly been trained on English-based data and ChatGPT has predominantly been used by English speakers. However, GPT-4 is able to perform with high accuracy across 26 languages, including Korean, Russian and Japanese.
